# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Performance-Benchmarking
This project aims to compare different path-finding algorithms in unweighted graphs to determine their efficiency in finding the shortest paths. The focus will be on generating unweighted graphs, implementing multiple path-finding algorithms, and evaluating their performance based on various metrics. 

Objectives:
- Implement a graph generator to create random unweighted graphs with varying sizes and densities. 
- Select and implement at least three path-finding algorithms suitable for unweighted graphs (BFS, DFS, and Bidirectional Search). 
- Develop a visualization tool to observe graph traversal and shortest path computation. 
- Measure algorithm performance based on nodes explored, execution time, and memory usage. 
- Analyze and compare the efficiency of different algorithms in various graph structures. 
- Document findings, challenges, and performance insights. 

Specifications:
- Programming Language: Python
- Development Tools: VS Code / PyCharm
- Libraries: Matplotlib (for visualization), NetworkX (for graph representation)
- Algorithms: BFS, DFS, and Bidirectional Search
- Metrics: Number of nodes explored, execution time, memory usage 

Algorithm Selection:
The following algorithms will be implemented and compared: 
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs. 
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Can explore paths quickly but does not guarantee the shortest path. 
- Bidirectional Search: Runs two simultaneous searches (from the start and goal nodes), reducing search space and improving efficiency.
